# Share your knowledge week 2023

This is a folder with the supporting files for my 'Writing Scientific Reports with RMarkdown' at the Share Your Knowledge Week 2023 organized by Erasmus University Rotterdam.

File description:

* `Instructions-Report.pdf` - An example with Latex formulas that we will reproduce in the workshop.
* `Preparation for workshop - Installing R and RStudio.pdf` - Preparation slides for downloading and installing R and R Studio
* `SYW (2023) - Introduction to R Markdown.pdf` - Slides from the workshop
* `Codes` folder - A complete example file that you can run on your computer. If pdf knitting is not available, change in the header for html format. You need to have the figure and the references file in the same folder as the rmd file.

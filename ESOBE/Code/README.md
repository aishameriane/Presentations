# Codes

The codes are in two separated languages. I am currently implementing everything in R, but since it is not fully functional, this is how it works right now:

* The data is downloaded and treated in R;
* It is then loaded in Matlab to estimate the model;
* The main results are loaded in R to make some graphs.
